# n2EDM-work
Masters stuff


This is my project for my MPhys at the University of Sussex. This is where I'll be documenting my work and completing all of my data anlysis. 

Some of the initial work has been taken straight from the PSI data (UCNCalcs.xlsx)

The majority of the calculations have been made by using equations taken directly from n2EDM papers from the Paul Scherrer Insitute (PSI) and the university of Sussex and my supervisor for this project.

Moved all my stuff onto GitHub on Sunday 11th February 2024 to better track exactly when I make any changes to my work.
