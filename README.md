Masters stuff


This is my project for my MPhys at the University of Sussex. This is where I'll be documenting my work and completing all of my data anlysis. 

Whilst my analysis is my own, any data used for anlysis (unless stated otherwise) is NOT MY OWN ANALYSIS. I am working with a research team to obtain data to conduct the analysis.

Moved all my stuff onto GitHub on Sunday 11th February 2024 to better track exactly when I make any changes to my work.

Log (Can check the commits and stuff there but this is a general log)

11/02/2024, -19:00, added graph for time evolution with velocity distribution. Not sure if the excel sheet is taking the correct values (etc, t800 is not taking the values for v at t=800s)

11/03/2024, finalise the calculations that allow the calculations for specific values. Mess around with the tau/Constant values in order to get a working double exponential fit. Plot the graph with both TOP and BOTTOM chambers now that you've been shown how to correct the obtained values.
