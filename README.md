# N2EDM-work
This is my work done during my MPhys at the university of Sussex. This was conducted under the guidance of my supervisor, and in collaboration with the Paul Scherrer Institute. I conducted data anlysis of the neutron count to analyse where, how and why neutrons are being lost from the predicted count.
